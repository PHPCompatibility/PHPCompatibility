This is a set of sniffs for [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer) that checks for PHP version compatibility.

Installation (method 1)
-----------------------

* Install [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer) with `pear install PHP_CodeSniffer` (PHP_CodeSniffer 1.5.1 or later is required for full support, notices may be thrown on older versions).
* Checkout this repository as `PHPCompatibility` into the `PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards` directory.
* Use the coding standard with `phpcs --standard=PHPCompatibility`
* You can specify which PHP version you want to test against by specifying `--runtime-set testVersion 5.5`.

Installation in Composer project (method 2)
-------------------------------------------

* Add the following lines to the `require-dev` section of your composer.json file.

```json
"require-dev": {
   "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": "*",
   "wimg/php-compatibility": "dev-master",
   "simplyadmire/composer-plugins" : "@dev"
},

```
* Run `composer update` to install both phpcs and PHPCompatibility coding standard.
* Use the coding standard with `./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PHPCompatibility`

Running the Sniff Tests
-----------------------
All the sniffs are fully tested with PHPUnit tests. In order to run the tests
on the sniffs, the following installation steps are required.

1. Install the master branch of `PHP_CodeSniffer`
   [https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git].

   This can be done with composer by adding the following into
   `~/.composer/composer.json`:

        {
            "require": {
                "phpunit/phpunit": "3.7.*",
                "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": ">=1.5.1,<2.2"
            }
        }

2. Run the following command to compose in the versions indicated in the above
   global composer.json file:

        $ composer.phar global install

3. Update your system `$PATH` to include the globally composed files:

        $ export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH

4. Be sure that the `PHPCompatibility` directory is symlinked into
   `PHP_Codesniffer`'s standards directory:

        $ ln -s /path/to/PHPCompatibility ~/.composer/vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/CodeSniffer/Standards/PHPCompatibility

5. Verify standard is available with `phpcs -i`. The output should include
   `PHPCompatibility`

6. Run the tests by running `phpunit` in the root directory of
   PHPCompatibility. It will read the `phpunit.xml` file and execute the tests
